In chrono we get an instance we have to ssh into, and the task description just asks in what way do we automate a task to run at intervals on a linux server.
On linux this is done by so called cronjobs, and one of the files where cron jobs can be found is /etc/crontab, and catting that file we get:

```bash
picoplayer@challenge:~$ cat /etc/crontab
# picoCTF{ find the flag yourself ;) }
```
