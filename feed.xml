So I did what everyone would do in this case, looked up power analysis, what it is, how it works. One of the things I found was this link, this pretty much explains what power analysis is, basically, when encrypt... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>PicoCTF 2023 - Specialer</title><link href="https://0x50d4.github.io/blog/posts/pico-specialer/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="PicoCTF 2023 - Specialer" /><published>2023-04-05T01:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2023-04-05T01:00:00+02:00</updated> <id>https://0x50d4.github.io/blog/posts/pico-specialer/</id> <content src="https://0x50d4.github.io/blog/posts/pico-specialer/" /> <author> <name>0x50D4</name> </author> <category term="PicoCTF2023" /> <summary> In specialer, we get given an instance that we have to ssh into, so let’s do that: ssh -p &amp;lt;port&amp;gt; ctf-player@saturn.picoctf.net and use the given password. We get a command line where we can try typing commands, so let’s try a few things: Specialer$ ls -bash: ls: command not found Specialer$ /bin/bash Specialer$ ../../../../bin/bash Specialer$ /bin/bsdlkfjsldkjflksdjf bash: /bin/bsdlkfj... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>PicoCTF 2023 - Chrono</title><link href="https://0x50d4.github.io/blog/posts/pico-chrono/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="PicoCTF 2023 - Chrono" /><published>2023-04-05T01:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2023-04-05T01:00:00+02:00</updated> <id>https://0x50d4.github.io/blog/posts/pico-chrono/</id> <content src="https://0x50d4.github.io/blog/posts/pico-chrono/" /> <author> <name>0x50D4</name> </author> <category term="PicoCTF2023" /> <summary> In chrono we get an instance we have to ssh into, and the task description just asks in what way do we automate a task to run at intervals on a linux server. On linux this is done by so called cronjobs, and one of the files where cron jobs can be found is /etc/crontab, and catting that file we get: picoplayer@challenge:~$ cat /etc/crontab # picoCTF{ find the flag yourself ;) } </summary> </entry> <entry><title>PicoCTF 2023 - Babygame01</title><link href="https://0x50d4.github.io/blog/posts/pico-babygame01/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="PicoCTF 2023 - Babygame01" /><published>2023-04-05T01:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2023-04-10T10:38:21+02:00</updated> <id>https://0x50d4.github.io/blog/posts/pico-babygame01/</id> <content src="https://0x50d4.github.io/blog/posts/pico-babygame01/" /> <author> <name>0x50D4</name> </author> <category term="PicoCTF2023" /> <summary> Babygame01 gave us a game, that we could both run locally and with an instance, that we had to exploit, we got a terminal based game, where we had to move to a place with a character that was a “@”, and then we won, but we also had to get the flag, which is the hard part This is how the game looks, we can move by typing in w a s or d.
