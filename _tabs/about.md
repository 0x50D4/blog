# $ whoami
My name is Soda and I'm a 16 year old student, who is learning cyber security in their free time. I am planning on posting blog posts like writeups and my personal findings. 

I will aim to provide entertaining but educational content for everyone for free. 

### Some more information about me
- I am a big fan of open source and Linux
- I somewhat know how to code in several programming languages(C++, Python, Lua) but I am no expert at any of them
- I run Debian, and install the tools myself
